        Appoint someone to handle your tax return
      </h1>
      <p>
        Use this service to allow someone else to deal with your Self Assessment tax return.
        This person will be known as your agent. An agent can be:

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>an accountant or tax adviser</li>
          <li>a friend or relative</li>
          <li>someone from a voluntary organisation</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also allow them to deal with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) about other matters.
        These include National Insurance contributions and current Tax Credit claims.
      </p>

      <div class="panel panel-border-wide">
        <p>
          Your agent must be registered for HMRC online services. You'll need to know their Government Gateway Agent ID.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you don't know the person's Agent ID, you can <a href="">complete and send a PDF form instead</a>.
